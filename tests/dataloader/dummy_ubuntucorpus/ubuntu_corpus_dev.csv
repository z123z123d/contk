Any ideas on how lts will be released ? __eou__ __eot__ already is __eou__ __eot__ ,We are talking 12.04 not 10.04 __eou__,you remember my flash issue from yesterday or the day before? __eou__,"oh, no idea other is probably ok __eou__ update-manager or even apt __eou__ it will be sorted to the right package by a bug triager, dont worry about it to much __eou__ since unity is a compiz plugin i would say everyone who uses unity does :) __eou__ as i said above, unity is a compiz plugin ... so it would be heavily noticed if compiz wouldnt work __eou__","no, greenit is saying his download speeds are slow, when connecting to a machine on his same LAN. I'm unsure why you think setting it up to go to the internet would be A) easier, and B) make it any faster __eou__ well that is probably the issue then. He needs to be at 1280x1024 instead of 1024x768 __eou__","lsb_release -sc __eou__ well... regardless. I believe the solution is going to be to live boot to cd, chroot into the machine and set a password. __eou__ Boot to live cd. Open a terminal and type sudo -s. mount /dev/sdXY /mnt      where X is the disk and Y is the partition. Typically /dev/sda1.  then chroot /mnt. To create a user: useradd -G admin mynewusername       using an actual user name. __eou__ if we were doing more than this we would want to mount more things... but for this we shouldnt need to __eou__ then, because I like things clean, umount /dev/sda1 (or whatever your partition is) and reboot to the hd. __eou__ you would have to type exit before the umount... sorry... to leave the chroot jail __eou__ at login, press the little icon thingy in the corner and choose Unity. __eou__",you can buy _anything_ in China __eou__,no __eou__,sudo restart lightdm __eou__,you are still asking for the unity logout menu right? __eou__,"so I am working as a linux admin intern, and my boss told me to use ""sudo su -"" __eou__ all RHEL or centos boxes; is there a reason for that? __eou__ is it a traditional thing? did sudo -i not exist at some point __eou__"
how much hdd use ubuntu default install ? __eou__ __eot__ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements __eou__ it wont require 15gb to be honest... __eou__ __eot__ ,thats why i ask how much is default install ? :) __eou__,all of this possible in older versions of Ubuntu __eou__ *was possible __eou__,: is that a question ? __eou__,yes __eou__,"thanks __eou__ I would imagine so, the site bonny linked earlier explicitly states turn hamachi off __eou__",yes I've investigated that already. It seems you can't treat both super keys differently. __eou__,not really.  i use urxvt myself. __eou__,"thanks a lot, really! __eou__","as someone else suggested, close update-manager, and open from terminal update-manager -d   but... it might be wise to wait for a point release. 1204 is als VERY different than 1004. You might grab a dvd and load it in VM and see if you are comfortable with the change. __eou__",you're welcome .. since 12.04 throws dnsmasq into the mix by default (see http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/) complexities rise a bit .. maybe that page has some info on squid __eou__

Fun thing is, that if one machine runs 11.10 and the other 12.04, the request from 12.04 to 11.10 works, and a connection can be made. If both are 12.04 it doesn't work. __eou__ I've been thinking the same thing. I guess I'll have to file one :( __eou__ just wanted to check, not that I'm being stupid. __eou__ didn't test that since the other computer is 12.04 (a relative of mine) and I run different ubuntu versions on vbox. __eou__ oh, 64MB? well then... ;) __eou__ he should have enough RAM to keep it in tmpfs. __eou__",so it has two be a two-command process? __eou__,"And because you only have 3 GB of ram, is not justified to run a 64 bit system there as 32 bit would run faster. __eou__",its ok but no error? then how do you know its a problem with dhcp client? __eou__
